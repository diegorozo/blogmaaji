					<span><p>Discover how your inner energy flows and become a powerhouse of #MAAJIC!</p></span>
						<span><p>What is MINDFULNESS? Living in the moment, awakening to experience, focusing your full attention on your breath as it flows in and out of your body; observing without criticism, enjoying the present moment...yes, it is for sure the secret to happiness! </p></span>
					<p>As you know, we are all big supporters of yoga and all activities that bring us wellness and allow us to be happier, more relaxed and practice mindfulness on a daily basis. And to keep it all flowing smoothly….nothing works better than opening your chakras! With that in mind, we want to share with all of you how we can pamper and open up them to make sure we can shine bright with all of our sparkle</p>
					<p>We all have 7 chakras, which are the ones that keep our inner energy spinning and flowing. Each one has its own ways of twinkling, and so we need to give each and every single one of them very special care. Let us suggest this is a good time to light a candle, play some relaxing music and make some time to pamper yourself to read and apply this, and you will feel rejuvenated! We promise!</p>
					
					<span><p>1.	Root Chakra (Muladhara)</p></span>
					<p>The “COURAGE” chakra. Located at the base of our spine and allows us to feel safe and secure. It is the base, the root to let energy flow through the rest of the chakras. Visualize it in a bright red color and bring a sense of being grounded and self-assured to open it. </p>
					
					
					<span><p>2.	The Sacral Chakra (Svadisthana)</p></span>
					<p>This is the CREATIVTY and SEXUAL chakra. Its color is orange and it is located between the base of our spine and our navel. It is concerned with EMOTION. To help healing it and empowering it practice self-love and self-respect. Do light-spirited activities and let your kid at heart, play and allow yourself to explore and awaken your creativity, putting fears aside and taking risks while love and energy flow for healing purposes.</p>
					
					
					<span><p>3.	The Solar Plexus (Manipura)</p></span>
					<p>Covered in yellow and located a few inches above the navel in the solar plexus area. This is where our super powers come from ;) ..ok maybe we won’t really fly after opening it but we will definitely feel empowered and with more inner-strength. This Chakra is what we could call the “throne” for our SELF-ESTEEM and the warrior we all have within us. Your sensitivity, ambition and ability to achieve… pretty much live here.</p>
					
					
					<span><p>4.	The Heart (Anahata) </p></span>
					<p>This is the LOVE Chakra! And surprisingly its color is green and yes! it does “live” within our heart. It is the center of love, compassion, harmony and peace. As Asians call it, this is the house of the soul. So if you feel like you are in love…this is where it all begins! Then (that’s why it’s so important to keep energy flowing) that feeling of unconditional love moves to the emotional center (known as the solar plexus). After that, it moves into the Base Chakra where strong feelings of attraction can be released. We know it might sound silly but to keep it open allow yourself to receive love…which truly happens when you give love…Because it all is a spinning wheel and it all comes straight back at us!</p>
					
					
					<span><p>5.	The Throat (Vishuddha) </p></span>
					<p>Represented with blue or turquoise and located within the throat. It is the Chakra of COMMUNICATION, creativity, self-expression and judgement. This Chakra is the passage of the energy between the lower parts of the body and the head. You can open it by wearing that pretty blue stone necklace or also meditating while visualizing yourself as we like to imagine in the ocean…surrounded by the deep grand blue and turquoise color.  </p>
					
					
					<span><p>6.	The Third Eye (Ajna) </p></span>
					<p>Its color is Indigo (a combination of red and blue). Located at the center of our forehead. This Chakra is the center of INTUITION and foresight. This is a special kind of temple: Where all of our dreams for this life and recollections of other lifetimes are guarded. To help open it lets keep on dreaming and focus our mind and consciousness, to see beyond distractions and illusions so we can live and create in symphony with our deepest good. </p>
					
					
					<span><p>7. The Crown (Sahasrara)</p></span>
					<p>Colored with violet, located at the top of our head, and it is associated with SPIRITUALITY. It is said to be our own place of connection to God, the Chakra of Divine purpose and personal destiny.  This chakra allows us to go beyond materialistic needs to connect with the universe as a whole. So yes! Just as you are thinking, this one Chakra plays a very important role, and when opened brings mindfulness and the ability to live with self-confidence and light within all aspects of our life! Meditation and nurturing the body with hearty, healthy foods while focusing on spiritual things can help heal and open this chakra. Just remember they are all connected and like a ray of light, energy travels within us! <br><br>
					Let’s all finish the year strong and with all of our Chakras wide open and our energy flowing and shining to welcome the NEW YEAR!! Make sure you check our DIY Rituals to be ready for 2017! And to help continue opening your energy centers you can also practice Chakra Yoga, which incorporates postures and controlled breath, known as pranayama, to cleanse, balance, and open the chakras of the body
